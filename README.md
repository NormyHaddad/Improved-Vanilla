# Improved Vanilla
### About:
This mod adds features to Minecraft which I or other players think would be a good idea. Things such as more uses to glow ink, a new wood type, and more uses to the sniffer (including 1 scrapped feature which players loved). 

**(Screenshots and videos available on portfolio, linked in resume)**
## Features
### Glowing wool
 - Glowing wool added in all colours except black
 - Each block glows and emits light
 - Craftable with 1 wool of any colour and 1 glow ink sac
### Revamped sniffer plants
 - Torchflower now glows and emits light (a requested feature in the main game)
 - Pitcher pods now spawn firefly particles at night (a scrapped feature many players loved)
### New tree and wood type
 - Added maple trees, with bright orange yellow and red leaves
 - Wood is  a very pale yellow-brown, lighter and less saturated than birch wood, which many players think is ugly

	 - Maple log

	 - Stripped maple wood
	 - Maple planks
